# 👋 Hi, I’m Sayantan

**Real-Time Systems Engineer | Professional Game Developer** **3+ Years Production Experience | Unity & C#**

I build gameplay systems, tools, and architectures designed to survive the chaos of live production. I specialize in the bridge between "it works on my machine" and "it works for a million players."

---

## 🧠 What I Bring to the Table
* **Scalable Gameplay Systems:** Architecture that accommodates feature requests without structural collapse.
* **Legacy Code Specialist:** Navigating and improving large, tightly-coupled projects without needing a "total rewrite."
* **Tooling & Frameworks:** Developing custom Editor tools and reusable systems that actively reduce tech debt.
* **Hardcore Debugging:** Solving those "2 AM, device-specific, post-hotfix" nightmares.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

| Category | Tools & Languages |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | C# (Production-grade), C++ (Systems & Fundamentals) |
| **Engine** | Unity (Gameplay, Editor Scripting, Tooling) |
| **Specialties** | Modular Architecture, Performance Optimization, Tweening/Animation Systems |
| **Workflow** | Git, Refactoring Live Codebases, Debugging Complex Interdependencies |

## 🧩 Engineering Philosophy
* **Readability > Cleverness:** Code is read much more often than it is written.
* **Scalability is a Requirement:** If it doesn’t scale, it’s a prototype, not a product.
* **Correctness over Convenience:** "It works" is the start of the conversation, not the end.
* **Future-Proofing:** I write code today so that "Future Me" doesn't have to spend his weekends fixing "Past Me's" shortcuts.

---

## 🤝 Let’s Collaborate
I’m interested in **serious projects** that require high-level technical ownership:
* Core Gameplay Systems & Mechanics
* Custom Developer Tools & Workflow Automation
* Production-ready Prototypes

> **Requirement:** Clear goals, realistic scope, and mutual respect.

⭐ *I write code so future me doesn’t curse present me. It doesn’t always work, but I try.*
